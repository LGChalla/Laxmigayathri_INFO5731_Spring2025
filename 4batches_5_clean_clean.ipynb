      "        \"content\": \"Forehead liftTo use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.A forehead lift is a surgical procedure to correct sagging of the forehead skin, eyebrows, and upper eyelids. It may also improve the look of wrinkles in the forehead and between the eyes.DescriptionA forehead lift removes or changes the muscles and skin that cause signs of aging as drooping eyebrows, \\\"hooding\\\" eyelids, forehead furrows, and frown lines.The surgery may be done alone or with other procedures such as afacelift, eyelid surgery, ornose reshaping. The surgery can be done in a surgeon's office, an outpatient surgery center, or a hospital. It is usually done on an outpatient basis, without an overnight stay.You will be given local anesthesia so that you will not feel pain. You might also get medicine torelax you. In some cases,general anesthesiawill be used. During the procedure, you will feel some stretching of the forehead skin and possibly some discomfort. During the surgery:Sections of hair will be held away from the surgery area. Hair right in front of the cut line may need to be trimmed, but large areas of hair will not be shaved.The surgeon will make a surgical cut (incision) at ear level. That cut will continue across the top of the forehead at the hairline so that the forehead does not look too high.If you arebaldor balding, the surgeon may use a cut in the middle of the scalp to avoid a visible scar.Some surgeons will use several small cuts and perform the surgery using anendoscope(a long thin instrument that has a small camera on the end). Dissolvable implants may be used to hold the lifted skin in place.After removing excess tissue, skin, and muscle, the surgeon will close the cut with stitches or staples. Before dressings are applied, your hair and face will be washed so the scalp skin does not get irritated.Why the Procedure is PerformedThis procedure is most often done on people in their 40s to 60s to slow the effects of aging. It can also help people with inherited conditions, such as furrowed lines above the nose or a droopy eyebrow.In younger people, a forehead lift can raise low eyebrows that give the face a sad look. The procedure can also be done in people whose brows are so low that they block the upper part of their field of vision.A good candidate for a forehead lift has one or more of the following:Deep furrows between the eyesHorizontal wrinkles on the foreheadSagging browsTissue that hangs down at the outer part of the eyelidsProblem seeing because of the hanging tissueRisksRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:Reaction to medicinesBreathing problemsBleeding,blood clots, infectionRisks of forehead lift surgery include:A pocket of blood under the skin (hematoma) that may need to be drained surgicallyDamage to the nerves that control muscles of the face (this is usually temporary, but may be permanent)Wounds that do not heal wellPain that does not go awayAsymmetry of the eyebrowNumbnessor other changes in skin sensationOccasionally, forehead lifts will make it hard to raise the eyebrows or wrinkle the forehead on one or both sides. If this happens, you might need more surgery to make both sides even. If you have already had plastic surgery to lift your upper eyelids, a forehead lift may not be recommended because it could affect your ability to close your eyelids.In most people, the cut for the forehead lift is under the hairline. If you have a high orreceding hairline, you may be able to see a thin scar after surgery. You will need to style your hair so that it partly covers your forehead.If the forehead skin is pulled too tightly or there is a lot ofswelling, a wide scar may form. In some cases, hair loss may occur along the scar edges. This can be treated by surgically removing the scar tissue or areas of hair loss so a new scar can form. Permanent hair loss after a forehead lift is rare.Before the ProcedureBefore your surgery, you will have a consultation. This will include a history, physical exam, and a psychological evaluation. You may want to bring someone (such as your spouse) with you during the visit.Feel free to ask questions. Be sure you understand the answers to your questions. You must understand fully the preoperative preparations, the procedure itself, and the care after surgery.Tell your surgeon or nurse if:You are or could be pregnantYou are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescriptionDuring the week before your surgery:You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that reduce the ability of your blood to clot. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.On the day of surgery:Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.Arrive at the hospital on time.Be sure to follow any other specific instructions from your surgeon.After the ProcedureThe area is wrapped with a sterile padding and an elastic bandage to prevent bleeding and swelling (edema). You will feel numbness and temporary discomfort in the surgical site, which you can control with medicine.You'll need to keep your head raised for 2 to 3 days after surgery to prevent swelling.Bruisingand swelling will occur around the eyes and cheeks, but should begin to disappear in a few days or a week.As nerves regrow, numbness of the forehead and scalp will be replaced with itching or tingling. It may take up to 6 months for these sensations to fully disappear. The bandages will be removed a day or two after surgery. Within 10 to14 days, the stitches or clips will be removed in two stages.Outlook (Prognosis)You will be able to walk around in 1 to 2 days, but you will not be able to work for at least 7 days after surgery. You can shampoo and shower 2 days after surgery, or as soon as the bandages are removed.Within 10 days, you should be able to go back to work or school. You should limit vigorous physical activity (jogging, bending, heavy housework, sex, or any activity that increases your blood pressure) for several weeks. Avoid contact sports for 6 to 8 weeks. Limit exposure to heat or sun for several months.Hair shafts will be a bit thinner around the cut for a few weeks or months, but the hair should start to grow normally again. Hair will not grow in the line of the actual scar. Wearing your hair down on your forehead will hide most scars.Most signs of the surgery should fade completely within 2 to 3 months. Makeup can cover minor swelling and bruising. At first, you'll probably feel tired and let down, but that will pass as you begin to look and feel better.Most people are pleased with the results of a forehead lift. They appear much younger and more rested than they did before. The procedure reduces the look of aging for years. Even if you do not have the surgery repeated in later years, you will probably look better than if you had never had a forehead lift.Alternative NamesEndobrow lift; Open browlift; Temporal liftImagesForehead lift  - seriesReferencesNiamtu J, Cuzalina A.

People with any type of diabetes can have these symptoms. Some other symptoms, and how quickly the symptoms develop, depend on the type of diabetes that you have. Talk with your primary health care professional about any symptoms you are having and ask if you should betested for diabetes. Your primary health care professional may be a doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner.Type 1 diabetes symptomsIn addition to some of the common diabetes symptoms listed above, people withtype 1 diabetesmay also have an unexplained weight loss. Most people don’t know they have type 1 diabetes until they develop diabetes symptoms.Symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually develop quickly, over a few days or weeks. Type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed in children and young adults, but it can begin at any age. Children with type 1 diabetes typically develop symptoms over a short period of time. Common symptoms of type diabetes in children includehaving to urinate more ofteneating more but losing weightfeeling very thirstyThese symptoms are less common in adults with type 1 diabetes. For some adults, symptoms of type 1 diabetes may develop slowly and seem more liketype 2 diabetes. Some adults who develop diabetes may need special tests to find out what type of diabetes they have. Talk with your health care professional about the type of diabetes you may have. They can help you understand its causes and treatments.Sometimes, people find out they have type 1 diabetes when they have signs and symptoms of a condition calleddiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Symptoms of DKA may includefeeling very tiredhaving trouble breathinghaving fruity-smelling breathfainting fromdehydrationhaving pain in yourabdomen,nausea, orvomitingIf you have type 1 diabetes, your body doesn’t have enoughinsulinto use blood glucose—also called blood sugar—for energy. Your body will begin to usefatas a source of energy instead. This process produces substances calledketones. High levels of ketones can cause DKA, which is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away.DKA usually affects people with type 1 diabetes. People with type 2 diabetes may also develop DKA if their body doesn’t produce enough insulin.Type 2 diabetes symptomsSymptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop slowly, over several years. Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms, or symptoms can be so mild that people might not even notice them. In addition to the common symptoms of diabetes listed above, people may find out they have type 2 diabetes when they develop symptoms of otherhealth problems from diabetes. These includepain, numbness, or tingling in the feet or handssexual problemschest painvision lossVision loss can be a symptom of diabetes.Gestational diabetes symptomsGestational diabetesis a type of diabetes that may develop when you are pregnant. Most people with this type of diabetes have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms of gestational diabetes, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than usual or having tourinatemore often.People with a history of gestational diabetes are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. If you have a history of gestational diabetes, your health care professional may recommend regular testing for type 2 diabetes.What causes type 1 diabetes?Type 1 diabetes develops when the body’simmune systemdestroys the cells in thepancreasthat make insulin. These cells are called beta cells. Genes and factors in the environment—the places where people live, play, work, study, and gather—may trigger the immune system to destroy beta cells in type 1 diabetes.Insulin is ahormonethat helps blood glucose get into the body’s cells to be used as energy. When your body doesn’t have enough insulin, glucose in your blood can’t get into the cells. As a result, your cells lack energy, your blood glucose level rises, and you develop diabetes.Studies such asThe Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY)are trying to learn more about the causes of type 1 diabetes.Type 1 Diabetes TrialNetand other groups are working to find treatments that may prevent or slow the development of type 1 diabetes in people who are at risk for getting the disease.What causes type 2 diabetes?Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes develops when your pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, and your body has trouble using insulin, a condition calledinsulin resistance. Insulin resistance is when the cells in your muscles, fat, andliverdon’t respond well to insulin. When there isn’t enough insulin to balance blood glucose levels, they begin to rise.When blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, you have a condition calledprediabetes. You have type 2 diabetes when health care professionals diagnose your blood glucoselevelas being too high.Researchers don’t fully know what causes problems with insulin production and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. However, people are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if theyhaveoverweight, obesity, or a large waist size.are age 35 or older. Children and teens can also develop type 2 diabetes, but the risk increases as a person gets older.have a family history of type 2 diabetes.are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic, Latino, or Pacific Islander.are not physically active, because of a job that requires sitting for long periods of time or because of difficulty moving their body.smoke, including tobacco products ande-cigarettes, or are exposed tosecondhand smoke.have prediabetes.have a history of gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy, or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.You can’t change some of these risk factors, such as your age, family history, or race. However, you may be able to change some risk factors andprevent or delay type 2 diabetesby maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, and stopping smoking.You may be able to prevent type 2 diabetes by maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active.What causes gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can’t make the extra insulin that you need during pregnancy. Scientists believe that substances made in your body, called hormones, may play a role in causing this form of diabetes.Changes to hormones during pregnancy can make it harder for blood glucose to enter the cells in your body. This causes insulin resistance. In most pregnancies, the pancreas can make enough insulin to overcome these changes. If the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, you’ll develop gestational diabetes.You’re more likely to develop gestational diabetes if you have certain risk factors, such ashaving overweight or obesitygaining too much weight during pregnancyhaving a family history of gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or bothWhat else can cause diabetes?Other causes of diabetes may includediseases caused by changes in yourgenes, also called gene variantsendocrine diseasesdamage to or removal of the pancreastaking certain medicinesDiseases caused by changes in your genesGene variantsare changes to certain genes. Some gene variants can cause diseases that can affect the pancreas and lead to diabetes.Monogenic diabetesMonogenic diabetesis a group of rare forms of diabetes caused by a variant, or change, in a single gene. Parents may pass these gene variants to their children. In some cases, a person may be the first one with the variant in the family. Most forms of monogenic diabetes reduce the amount of insulin your pancreas can make.Cystic fibrosisCystic fibrosisis a genetic disease that leads to swelling and scarring in the pancreas. This scarring can prevent the pancreas from making enough insulin.HemochromatosisHemochromatosisis a genetic condition that causes your body and organs to build up harmful levels ofiron. If the disease is not treated, high levels of iron may damage your pancreas and other organs.Endocrine diseasesSome endocrine diseases make the body produce too much of certain hormones. High levels of these hormones may cause insulin resistance or diabetes. Endocrine diseases that may cause insulin resistance or diabetes includeCushing’s syndrome, which can cause the body to produce too muchcortisol—often called the “stress hormone”acromegaly, which can cause the body to produce too much growth hormonehyperthyroidism, which can cause the body to produce too much thyroid hormonehypothyroidism, which can cause the body to produce too little thyroid hormoneDamage to or removal of the pancreasThe pancreas can be damaged by injury or diseases such as inflammation of the pancreas, also calledpancreatitis. Diabetes may be the first sign ofpancreatic cancerin older people without diabetes risk factors who develop diabetes. A damaged pancreas may make less insulin and lead to diabetes. In some cases, your pancreas may need to be removed. Without a pancreas, your body can’t produce insulin. You’ll develop diabetes and will have to take insulin.Taking certain medicinesCertain medicines may harm the pancreas or affect the way insulin works in the body. Some of these medicines may includeantipsychoticsthat are used to treat certain mental health problemsantiseizure medicines that are used to treatepilepsybeta-blockers and diureticsthat are used to treat high blood pressureglucocorticoidsthat are used to treat certain inflammatory diseasesimmunosuppressantsthat are used after an organ transplantniacin, a type of vitamin B that is sometimes used to treat high blood cholesterolStatins, which are medicines to reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels, can slightly increase the chance that you’ll develop diabetes. However, statins help protect you fromheart diseaseandstroke. For this reason, the strong benefits of taking statins outweigh the small chance that you could develop diabetes.If you take medicines for these conditions, you may want to ask your primary health care professional if your medicines could affect your risk of developing diabetes.Clinical Trials for Symptoms and Causes of DiabetesNIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including diabetes. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and improve quality of life.What clinical trials study symptoms and causes of diabetes?Clinical trials—and other types ofclinical studies—are part of medical research and involve people like you. When you volunteer to take part in a clinical study, you help doctors and researchers learn more about disease and improve health care for people in the future.Researchers are studying many aspects of symptoms and causes of diabetes, such astests and treatments for rare and uncommon types of diabetesbody changes in people who develop diabetes after having pancreatitisFind out if clinical trials are right for you.Watch a video of NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers explaining the importance of participating in clinical trials.What clinical trials about symptoms and causes of diabetes are looking for participants?You can find clinical studies on symptoms and causes of diabetes atClinicalTrials.gov. In addition to searching for federally funded studies, you can expand or narrow your search to include clinical studies from industry, universities, and individuals; however, the National Institutes of Health does not review these studies and cannot ensure they are safe for you. Always talk with your primary health care professional before you participate in a clinical study.What have we learned about symptoms and causes of diabetes from NIDDK-funded research?NIDDK has funded many research projects to learn more about symptoms and causes of diabetes.NIDDK-supported researchhelped scientists find genes linked to type 1 diabetes and new ways to identify people with type 1 diabetes before they develop symptoms.NIDDK also supported research to test medicines in people with type 1 diabetes before symptoms develop and before they require insulin-replacement therapy. In 2022, this research led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationapproval of a medicine(PDF, 101.1 KB)that may slow damage to the pancreas in early stages of type 1 diabetes.TheDiabetes Prevention Program (DPP)studied how to prevent or delay disease in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that participants who did regular physical activity and lost 5% to 7% of their body weight lowered their chance of developing type 2 diabetes.NIDDK funds theGlycemic Observation and Metabolic Outcomes in Mothers and Offspring (GO MOMS)study, which is investigating ways to improve gestational diabetes screening and diagnosis by better understanding blood glucose levels throughout pregnancy. GO MOMs will set the foundation for future ways to screen, diagnose, and treat high blood glucose levels during pregnancy.NIDDK supports theRare and Atypical Diabetes Network (RADIANT)study, which is looking at ways to identify and define rare and atypical forms of diabetes.NIDDK formed theType 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium (T1DAPC)to study type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes that are related to acute pancreatitis. As part of this group, the Diabetes Related to Acute Pancreatitis and Its Mechanisms (DREAM) study is looking at people with recent acute pancreatitis to see how many develop diabetes.Last Reviewed October 2024Sharethis pagePrintFacebookXEmailMore OptionsWhatsAppLinkedInRedditPinterestCopy LinkPrevious:What Is Diabetes?Next:Risk Factors for Type 2 DiabetesThis content is provided as a service of theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases(NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health.

      "Ground Truth: uterine fibroidsto use the sharing features on this page, please enable javascript.uterine fibroids are tumors that grow in a woman's womb (uterus). these growths are typically not cancerous (benign), and do not become cancerous.causesuterine fibroids are common. as many as one in five women may have fibroids during their childbearing years. half of all women have fibroids by age 50.fibroids are rare in women under age 20. they are more common in african americans than white, hispanic, or asian women.no one knows exactly what causes fibroids. they are thought to be caused by:hormones in the bodygenes (may run in families)fibroids can be so tiny that you need a microscope to see them. they can also grow very large. they may fill the entire uterus and may weigh several pounds or kilograms. although it is possible for just one fibroid to develop, most often there is more than one.fibroids can grow:in the muscle wall of the uterus (myometrial)just under the surface of the uterine lining (submucosal)just under the outside lining of the uterus (subserosal)on a long stalk on the outside of the uterus or inside the uterus (pedunculated)symptomscommon symptoms of uterine fibroids are:bleeding between periodsheavy bleeding during your period, sometimes with blood clotsperiods that may last longer than normalneeding to urinate more oftenpelvic cramping or pain with periodsfeeling fullness or pressure in your lower bellypain during intercourseoften, you can have fibroids and not have any symptoms. your health care provider may find them during a physical exam or other test. fibroids often shrink and cause no symptoms in women who have gone through menopause. a recent study also showed that some small fibroids shrink in premenopausal women.exams and testsyour provider will perform a pelvic exam. this may show that you have a change in the shape and size of your womb.fibroids are not always easy to diagnose. being obese may make fibroids harder to detect. you may need these tests to look for fibroids:ultrasounduses sound waves to create a picture of the uterus.mriuses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a picture of the uterus.saline infusion sonogram (hysterosonography) -- saline is injected into the uterus to make it easier to see the uterus using ultrasound.hysteroscopy uses a long, thin tube inserted through the vagina and into the uterus to examine the inside of the uterus.endometrial biopsyremoves a small piece of the lining of the uterus to check for cancer if you have unusual bleeding.treatmentwhat type of treatment you have depends on:your ageyour general healthyour symptomstype of fibroidsif you are pregnantif you want children in the futurelocation and size of the fibroidstreatment for the symptoms of fibroids may include:intrauterine devices (iuds) that release hormones to help reduce heavy bleeding and pain.tranexamic acid to reduce the amount of blood flow.iron supplements to prevent or treatanemiadue to heavy periods.pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, for cramps or pain.watchful waiting -- you may have follow-up pelvic exams or ultrasounds to check the fibroid's growth.medical or hormonal therapies that may help shrink fibroids include:birth control pills to help control heavy periods.a type of iud that releases a low dose of the hormone progestin into the uterus each day.combination oral medication that suppresses hormone production to treat heavy periods while preventing menopausal like symptoms (gnrh antagonist).hormone shots to help shrink fibroids by stopping ovulation. most often, this therapy is used only for a short time to shrink fibroids before surgery. they can also be used longer when small amounts of estrogen hormone are added back to reduce side effects.surgery and procedures used to treat fibroids include:hysteroscopy-- this procedure can remove fibroids growing inside the uterus.endometrial ablation-- this procedure is sometimes used to treat heavy bleeding associated with fibroids. it works best when the fibroids are small in size. it often stops menstruation completely.uterine artery embolization-- this procedure stops the blood supply to the fibroid, causing it to shrink and die. this may be a good option if you wish to avoid surgery and are not planning to become pregnant.myomectomy -- this surgery removes the fibroids from the uterus. this also may be a good choice if you want to have children. it will not prevent new fibroids from growing.hysterectomy-- this surgery removes the uterus completely. it may be an option if you do not want children, medicines do not work, and you cannot have any other procedures.radiofrequency ablation - this procedure places a small needle into the fibroid under ultrasound guidance and uses heat to destroy fibroid tissue causing the fibroid to shrink.newer treatments, such as the use of focused ultrasound, are being evaluated in clinical studies.outlook (prognosis)if you have fibroids without symptoms, you may not need treatment.if you have fibroids, they may grow if you become pregnant. this is due to the increased blood flow and higher estrogen levels. the fibroids usually return to their original size after your baby is born.possible complicationscomplications of fibroids include:severe pain or very heavy bleeding that needs emergency surgery.twisting of the fibroid -- this can cause blocked blood vessels that feed the tumor. you may need surgery if this happens.anemia (not having enough red blood cells) from heavy bleeding.urinary tract infections -- if the fibroid presses on the bladder, it can be hard to empty your bladder completely.infertility, in rare cases.if you are pregnant, there's a small risk that fibroids may cause complications:you may deliver your baby early because there is not enough room in your womb.if the fibroid blocks the birth canal or puts the baby in a dangerous position, you may need to have acesarean section(c-section).you may have heavy bleeding right after giving birth.when to contact a medical professionalcontact your provider if you have:heavy bleeding, increased cramping, orbleeding between periodsfullness or heaviness in your lower belly areaalternative namesleiomyoma; fibromyoma; myoma; fibroids; uterine bleeding -

      "Question: What are the treatments for Bartter syndrome ?\n",
      "Ground Truth: bartter syndrometo use the sharing features on this page, please enable javascript.bartter syndrome is a group of rare conditions that affect the kidneys.causesthere are five gene defects known to be associated with bartter syndrome. the condition is present at birth (congenital).the condition is caused by a defect in the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium. people affected by bartter syndrome lose too much sodium through the urine. this causes a rise in the level of the hormone aldosterone, and makes the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. this is known as potassium wasting.the condition also results in an abnormal acid balance in the blood called hypokalemic alkalosis, which causes too much calcium in the urine.symptomsthis disease usually occurs in childhood. symptoms include:constipationless weight gain than other children of similar age and sex (growth failure)frequent urination (urinary frequency)low blood pressurekidney stonesmuscle cramping and weaknessexams and testsbartter syndrome is usually suspected when a blood test finds alow level of potassium in the blood. unlike other forms of kidney disease, this condition does not cause high blood pressure. there is a tendency toward low blood pressure. laboratory tests may show:high urineâpotassium, calcium, andchloride levelshigh blood levels of the hormones,reninand aldosteronelow blood chloride levelmetabolicalkalosisthese same signs and symptoms can also occur in people who take too many diuretics (water pills) or laxatives. urine tests can be done to rule out other causes.an ultrasound of the kidneys may be done.treatmentbartter syndrome is treated by eating foods rich in potassium or taking potassium supplements.many people also need salt and magnesium supplements. medicine may be needed that blocks the kidney's ability to get rid of potassium. high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) may also be used.outlook (prognosis)infants who have severe growth failure may grow normally with treatment. over time, some people with the condition will developkidney failure.when to contact a medical professionalcontact your health care provider if your child is:having muscle crampsnot growing wellurinating frequentlyalternative namespotassium wasting; salt-wasting nephropathyimagesaldosterone level testreferencesguay-woodford lm. hereditary nephropathies and developmental renal/urinary abnormalities. in: goldman l, cooney ka, eds.goldman-cecil medicine. 27th ed. philadelphia, pa: elsevier; 2024:chap 113.kliegman rm, st. geme jw, blum nj, et al. inherited tubular transport abnormalities: bartter syndrome. in: kliegman rm, st. geme jw, blum nj, et al, eds.nelson textbook of pediatrics. 22nd ed. philadelphia, pa: elsevier; 2025:chap 571.mount db. disorders of potassium balance. in: yu asl, chertow gm, luyckx va, marsden pa, skorecki k, taal mw, eds.brenner and rector's the kidney. 11th ed. philadelphia, pa: elsevier; 2020:chap 17.review date 12/31/2023updated by: walead latif, md, nephrologist and clinical associate professor, rutgers medical school, newark, nj. review provided by verimed healthcare network. also reviewed by david c. dugdale, md, medical director, brenda conaway, editorial director, and the a.d.a.m. editorial team.learn how to cite this pagerelated medlineplus health topicskidney diseases\n",
      "Generated Answer: bartter syndrome is treated primarily by addressing the electrolyte imbalances and symptoms associated with the condition. the main treatments include: 1. **potassium supplements**: since bartter syndrome causes potassium wasting, patients are often advised to take potassium supplements to maintain normal potassium levels in the blood. 2. **dietary adjustments**: consuming foods rich in potassium can help manage the condition. this includes foods like bananas, oranges, and spinach. 3. **salt and magnesium supplements**: some individuals may require additional salt and magnesium supplements to address deficiencies and support electrolyte balance. 4. **medications**: medications that block the kidney's ability to excrete potassium, such as potassium-sparing diuretics, may be prescribed. additionally, high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) can be used to help manage symptoms. 5. **monitoring and support**: regular monitoring of electrolyte levels and kidney function is essential. supportive care for symptoms like muscle cramps and weakness may also be necessary. with appropriate treatment, many individuals with bartter syndrome can manage their symptoms effectively, although some may develop kidney failure over time.\n"

is when you do not pass stool as often as you normally do. your stool may become hard and dry, and it can be difficult to pass.signs, symptoms, and causesyou might feel bloated and have pain, or you might have to strain when you try to go.some medicines, and even some vitamins, can make you constipated. you can get constipated if you do not get enough fiber, drink enough water, or get enough exercise. you can also get constipated if you put off going to the bathroom even though you have the urge to go.try to get to know your normal bowel movement pattern, so that you can prevent constipation and keep it from getting worse.how to relieve constipationexercise regularly. drink more water and eatmore fiber. try to walk, swim, or do something active at least 3 or 4 times a week.if you feel the urge to go to the bathroom, go. do not wait or hold it in.you can also train your bowels to be more regular. it may help to go to the bathroom every day at the same time. for many people, this is after breakfast or dinner.eating when you have constipationtry these things to relieve your constipation:do not skip meals.avoid processed or fast foods, such as white breads, pastries, doughnuts, sausage, fast-food burgers, potato chips, and french fries.many foods are good natural laxatives that will help you move your bowels. high-fiber foods help move waste through your body. add foods with fiber to your diet slowly, because eating more fiber can cause bloating and gas.drink 8 to 10 cups (2 to 2.5 l) of liquids, particularly water, every day.ask your health care provider how much fiber to take each day. males, females, and different age groups all have different daily fiber needs.most fruits will help ease constipation. berries, grapes, peaches, apricots, plums, raisins, rhubarb, and prunes are just some of the fruits that may help. do not peel fruits that have edible skins, because a lot of the fiber is in the skin.choose breads, crackers, pasta, pancakes, and waffles made with whole grains, or make your own. use brown rice or wild rice instead of white rice. eat high-fiber cereals.vegetables can also add fiber to your diet. some high-fiber vegetables are asparagus, broccoli, corn, squash, and potatoes (with the skin still on). salads made with lettuce, spinach, and cabbage will also help.legumes (navy beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, soybeans, and lentils), peanuts, walnuts, and almonds will also add fiber to your diet.it is important to drink plenty of water when adding fiber to the diet or taking fiber supplements.other foods you can eat are:fish, chicken, turkey, or other lean meats. these do not have fiber, but they will not make constipation worse.snacks such as raisin cookies, fig bars, and popcorn.you can also sprinkle 1 or 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of bran flakes, ground flax seeds, wheat bran, or psyllium on foods such as yogurt, cereal, and soup. or, add them to your smoothie.laxatives, stool softeners, and other productsyou can buy stool softeners at any pharmacy. they will help you pass stool more easily.your provider may prescribe a laxative to relieve your constipation. it may be a pill or liquid. do not take it if you have severe stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting. do not take it for more than 1 week without consulting your provider. it should start to work in 2 to 5 days.only take a laxative as often as your provider recommends. most laxatives are taken with meals or at bedtime.you can mix powder laxatives with milk or fruit juice to make them taste better.always drink plenty of water (8 to 10 cups, or 2 to 2.5 l a day) when you are using laxatives.store your laxative medicine safely in a medicine cabinet, where children cannot get to it.do not take any other laxatives or medicines before talking with your provider. this includes mineral oil.some people get a rash, nausea, or a sore throat while taking laxatives. women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and children under age 6 years should not take laxatives without the advice of a provider.bulk-forming laxatives such as metamucil or citrucel can help pull water into your intestines and make your stools more bulky.when to contact

expected to need an opioid pain medication around the clock for a long time and who cannot be treated with other medications. buprenorphine patches should not be used to treat mild or moderate pain, short-term pain, or pain that can be controlled by medication that is taken as needed.it is in a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics. it works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.how should this medicine be used?transdermal buprenorphine comes as a patch to apply to the skin. the patch is usually applied to the skin once every 7 days. change your patch at about the same time of day every time you change it. follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. apply buprenorphine patches exactly as directed.your doctor may start you on a low dose buprenorphine patch and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 3 days. if this increase involves the use of two patches, remove your current patch and at the same time, place the two new patches next to each other at a new site. if your doctor tells you to use two patches, you should always change and apply them at the same time. your doctor may decrease your dose if you experience side effects. contact your doctor if the dose you are taking does not control your pain. talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with buprenorphine patches.buprenorphine skin patches are only for use on the skin. do not place patches in your mouth or chew or swallow the patches.do not stop using buprenorphine patches without talking to your doctor. your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. if you suddenly stop using buprenorphine patches you may have symptoms of withdrawal. call your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms of withdrawal: restlessness, teary eyes, runny nose, yawning, sweating, chills, hair standing on end, muscle aches, large pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes), irritability, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, pain in the joints, weakness, fast heartbeat, or rapid breathing.do not use a buprenorphine patch that is cut, damaged, or changed in any way. if you use cut or damaged patches, you may receive most or all of the medication at once, instead of slowly over 7 days. this may cause serious problems, including overdose and death.if your buprenorphine patch is exposed to extreme heat, it may release too much medication into your body at once. this can cause serious or life-threatening symptoms.do not expose your patch or the skin around it to direct heat such as heating pads, electric blankets, heat lamps, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds. do not take long, hot baths or sunbathe while you are wearing the patch.you may bathe or shower while you are wearing a buprenorphine patch. if the patch falls off during these activities, dispose of it properly. then

side of your chest. choose an area of skin that is flat and hairless. do not apply the patch to parts of the body that irritated, broken, cut, damaged, or changed in any way. if there is hair on the skin, use scissors to clip the hair as close to the skin as possible. do not shave the area. wait at least 3 weeks before applying a new patch to same site.tell your doctor if your pain increases or gets worse or if you have new pain or an increased sensitivity to pain, especially after applying a buprenorphine patch. do not apply more of it or apply it more often than prescribed by your doctor.to apply the patch, follow these steps:clean the area where you plan to apply the patch with clear water and pat completely dry. do not use any soaps, lotions, alcohols, or oils.use scissors to cut open the pouch containing the buprenorphine patch along the dotted line. remove the patch from the pouch and peel off the protective liner from the back of the patch. try not to touch the sticky side of the patch.immediately press the sticky side of the patch onto the chosen area of skin with the palm of your hand.press the patch firmly for at least 15 seconds. be sure that the patch sticks well to your skin, especially around the edges. do not rub the patch.if the patch does not stick well or comes loose after it is applied, tape only the edges to your skin with first aid tape. if the patch still does not stick well, you may cover it with bioclusive or tegaderm brand see-through dressings. do not cover the patch with any other type of bandages or tape. talk to your doctor or pharmacist if your patch continues to have problems sticking to your skin.if a patch falls off before it is time to remove it, dispose of the patch properly and apply a new patch at a different area of skin. leave the new patch in place for 7 days.when you are finished applying the patch, wash your hands with only clear water right away.write down the date and time that the patch is applied.when it is time to change your patch, peel off the old patch and apply a new patch to a different skin area.after you remove your patch, use the patch disposal unit provided to you by the manufacturer to safely dispose of the used patch in the trash. close the patch disposal unit by folding the sticky sides together, then press firmly and smoothly over the entire unit so that the patch is sealed within. do not place used patches in the trash without first sealing them in the patch disposal unit. alternatively, you may also may fold the sticky sides of a used patch together and flush it down

pituitary gland that helps promote growth. affected individuals are close to normal size at birth, but they experience slow growth from early childhood that results in very short stature. if the condition is not treated, adult males typically reach a maximum height of about 4.5 feet; adult females may be just over 4 feet tall.other features of untreated laron syndrome include reduced muscle strength and endurance, low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) in infancy, small genitals and delayed puberty, hair that is thin and fragile, and dental abnormalities. many affected individuals have a distinctive facial appearance, including a protruding forehead, a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose), and a blue tint to the whites of the eyes (blue sclerae). affected individuals have short limbs compared to the size of their torso, as well as small hands and feet. adults with this condition tend to develop obesity. however, the signs and symptoms of laron syndrome vary, even among affected members of the same family.studies suggest that people with laron syndrome have a significantly reduced risk of cancer andtype 2 diabetes. affected individuals appear to develop these common diseases much less frequently than their unaffected relatives, despite having obesity (a risk factor for both cancer and type 2 diabetes). however, people with laron syndrome do not seem to have an increased lifespan compared with their unaffected relatives.frequencylaron syndrome is a rare disorder. about 350 people have been diagnosed with the condition worldwide. the largest single group of affected individuals (about 100 people) lives in an area of southern ecuador.causeslaron syndrome is caused by mutations in theghrgene. this gene provides instructions for making a protein called thegrowth hormone receptor. the receptor is present on theouter membraneof cells throughout the body, particularly liver cells. as its name suggests, the growth hormone receptor attaches (binds) to growth hormone; the two proteins fit together like a key in a lock. when growth hormone is bound to its receptor, it triggerssignalingthat stimulates the growth and division of cells. this signaling also leads to the production, primarily by liver cells, of another important growth-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i).growth hormone and igf-i have a wide variety of effects on the growth and function of many parts of the body. for example, these hormones stimulate the growth and division of cells called chondrocytes, which play a critical role in producing new bone tissue. growth hormone and igf-i also influence metabolism, including how the body uses and stores carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from food.mutations in theghrgene impair the receptor's ability to bind to growth hormone or to trigger signaling within cells. as a result, even when growth hormone is available, cells are unable to respond by producing igf-i and stimulating growth and division. the cells' inability to react to growth hormone, which is described as growth hormone insensitivity, disrupts the normal growth and function of many different tissues. short stature results when growth hormone cannot adequately stimulate the growth of bones. changes in metabolism caused by insensitivity to growth hormone and the resulting shortage of igf-i cause many of the other features of the condition, including obesity.researchers are working to determine how mutations in theghrgene may protect people with laron syndrome from developing cancer and type 2 diabetes. studies suggest that insensitivity to growth hormone may help prevent the uncontrolled growth and division of cells that can lead to the development of cancerous tumors. growth hormone insensitivity also appears to alter how the body responds toinsulin, which is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. resistance to the effects of insulin is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. people with laron syndrome have the opposite situation, an increased sensitivity to insulin, which likely helps explain their reduced risk of this common disease.learn more about the gene associated with laron syndromeghrinheritancemost cases of laron syndrome are inherited in anautosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of theghrgene in each cell have mutations. the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.much less commonly, the condition has anautosomal dominant patternof inheritance, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. in most of these cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.other

disorder that occurs almost exclusively in girls. the most common form of the condition is known as classic rett syndrome. after birth, girls with classic rett syndrome have 6 to 18 months of apparently normal development before developing severe problems with language and communication, learning, coordination, and other brain functions. early in childhood, affected girls lose purposeful use of their hands and begin making repeated hand wringing, washing, or clapping motions. they tend to grow more slowly than other children and about three-quarters have a small head size (microcephaly). other signs and symptoms that can develop include breathing abnormalities, spitting or drooling, unusual eye movements such as intense staring or excessive blinking, cold hands and feet, irritability, sleep disturbances, seizures, and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis).researchers have described several variant or atypical forms of rett syndrome, which can be milder or more severe than the classic form.rett syndrome is part of a spectrum of disorders with the same genetic cause. other disorders on the spectrum includeppm-x syndrome,mecp2duplication syndrome, andmecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy. these other conditions can affect males.frequencythis condition affects an estimated 1 in 9,000 to 10,000 females.causesmutations in a gene calledmecp2underlie almost all cases of classic rett syndrome and some variant forms of the condition. this gene provides instructions for making a protein (mecp2) that is critical for normal brain function. although the exact function of the mecp2 protein is unclear, it is likely involved in maintaining connections (synapses) between nerve cells (neurons). it may also be necessary for the normal function of other types of brain cells.the mecp2 protein is thought to help regulate the activity of genes in the brain. this protein may also control the production of different versions of certain proteins in brain cells. mutations in themecp2gene alter the mecp2 protein or result in the production of less protein, which appears to disrupt the normal function of neurons and other cells in the brain. specifically, studies suggest that changes in the mecp2 protein may reduce the activity of certain neurons and impair their ability to communicate with one another. it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of rett syndrome.several conditions with signs and symptoms overlapping those of rett syndrome have been found to result from mutations in other genes. these conditions, includingfoxg1syndrome andcdkl5 deficiency disorder, were previously thought to be variant forms of rett syndrome. however, doctors and researchers have identified some important differences between the conditions, so they are now usually considered to be separate disorders.learn more about the gene associated with rett syndromemecp2inheritancein more than 99 percent of people with rett syndrome, there is no history of the disorder in their family. many of these cases result from new mutations in themecp2gene.a few families with more than one affected family member have been described. these cases helped researchers determine that classic rett syndrome and variants caused bymecp2gene mutations have anx-linked dominant patternof inheritance. a condition is considered x-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the x chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. the inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition.males with mutations in themecp2gene often die in infancy. however, a small number of males with a genetic change involvingmecp2have developed signs and symptoms similar to those of rett syndrome, including intellectual disability, seizures, and movement problems. in males, this condition is described asmecp2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy. the signs and symptoms in some males with anmecp2gene mutation are on the milder end of the spectrum.other names for this conditionautism-dementia-ataxia-loss of purposeful hand use syndromerett disorderrett's

at birth, but they experience slow growth from early childhood that results in very short stature. if the condition is not treated, adult males typically reach a maximum height of about 4.5 feet; adult females may be just over 4 feet tall. other features of untreated laron syndrome include reduced muscle strength and endurance, low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia) in infancy, small genitals and delayed puberty, hair that is thin and fragile, and dental abnormalities. many affected individuals have a distinctive facial appearance, including a protruding forehead, a sunken bridge of the nose (saddle nose), and a blue tint to the whites of the eyes (blue sclerae). affected individuals have short limbs compared to the size of their torso, as well as small hands and feet. adults with this condition tend to develop obesity. however, the signs and symptoms of laron syndrome vary, even among affected members of the same family. studies suggest that people with laron syndrome have a significantly reduced risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes.\",\n          \"rett syndrome is a brain disorder that occurs almost exclusively in girls. the most common form of the condition is known as classic rett syndrome. after birth, girls with classic rett syndrome have 6 to 18 months of apparently normal development before developing severe problems with language and communication, learning, coordination, and other brain functions. early in childhood, affected girls lose purposeful use of their hands and begin making repeated hand wringing, washing, or clapping motions. they tend to grow more slowly than other children, and about three-quarters have a small head size (microcephaly). other signs and symptoms that can develop include breathing abnormalities, spitting or drooling, unusual eye movements such as intense staring or excessive blinking, cold hands and feet, irritability, sleep disturbances, seizures, and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). researchers have described several variant or atypical forms of rett syndrome, which can be milder or more severe than the classic form.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

storage and disposal of this medication?in case of emergency/overdosewhat other information should i know?brand namesimportant warning:chlordiazepoxide may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take certain opiate medications for cough such as codeine (in triacin-c, in tuzistra xr) or hydrocodone (in anexsia, in norco, in zyfrel) or for pain such as codeine (in fiorinal), fentanyl (actiq, duragesic, subsys, others), hydromorphone (dilaudid, exalgo), meperidine (demerol), methadone (dolophine, methadose), morphine (astramorph, duramorph pf, kadian), oxycodone (in oxycet, in percocet, in roxicet, others), and tramadol (conzip, ultram, in ultracet). your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully. if you take the combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium with any of these medications and you develop any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care immediately: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.chlordiazepoxide may be habit forming. do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer time than your doctor tells you to. tell your doctor if you have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, if you use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications. do not drink alcohol or use street drugs during your treatment. drinking alcohol or using street drugs during your treatment with chlordiazepoxide also increases the risk that you will experience these serious, life-threatening side effects. also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.chlordiazepoxide may cause a physical dependence (a condition in which unpleasant physical symptoms occur if a medication is suddenly stopped or taken in smaller doses), especially if you take it for several days to several weeks. do not stop taking this medication or take fewer doses without talking to your doctor. stopping the combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium suddenly can worsen your condition and cause withdrawal symptoms that may last for several weeks to more than 12 months. your doctor probably will decrease your combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium dose gradually. call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: unusual movements; ringing in your ears; anxiety; memory problems; difficulty concentrating; sleep problems; seizures; shaking; muscle twitching; changes in mental health; depression; burning or prickling feeling in hands, arms, legs or feet; seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear; thoughts of harming or killing yourself or others; overexcitement; or losing touch with reality.why is this medication prescribed?the combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium is used along with other medications to treat peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs; a condition that causes stomach pain, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea), and enterocolitis (swelling in the intestines). chlordiazepoxide is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. it works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain. clidinium is in a class of medications called anticholinergics. it helps to decrease stomach spasms and cramps.how should this medicine be used?the combination of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium comes as a capsule to be taken by mouth. it usually is taken three or four times a day, before meals and at bedtime. follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. take chlordiazepoxide and clidinium exactly as directed.your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (medication guide) when you begin treatment with chlordiazepoxide and clidinium and each time you fill your prescription. read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. you can also visit the food and drug administration (fda) website (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/ucm085729.htm) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the medication guide.other uses for this medicinethis medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.what special precautions should i follow?before taking chlordiazepoxide and clidinium,tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to chlordiazepoxide, clidinium, any other medications, or any of the ingredients in chlordiazepoxide and clidinium capsules. ask your pharmacist for a list of the ingredients.tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking chlordiazepoxide and clidinium. your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking the following medications or have stopped taking them within the past two weeks: isocarboxazid (marplan), linezolid (zyvox), methylene blue, phenelzine (nardil), selegiline (eldepryl, emsam, zelapar), or tranylcypromine (parnate).tell your doctor if you have glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy (an enlarged prostate), or bladder neck obstruction (a blockage of your bladder that causes problems with urination). your doctor will probably tell you not to take chlordiazepoxide and clidinium.tell your doctor if you have or have ever had vision problems, urinary problems, or kidney or liver disease.tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. if you become pregnant while taking this medication, call your doctor immediately. clidinium-containing medications may
